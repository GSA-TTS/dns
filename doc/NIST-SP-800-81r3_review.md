# DNS Architecture Guidance Alignment Report

Based on the review of [NIST SP 800-81r3 "Secure Domain Name System Deployment Guide"](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/81/r3/ipd)

## Current Alignment with NIST SP 800-81r3

### Properly Implemented Components

1. **DNSSEC Implementation**
   - Proper DNSSEC key management with KMS for signing
   - Appropriate zone signing configurations
   - Trust anchors correctly established

2. **DNS Infrastructure Resilience**
   - Multiple authoritative servers for zones
   - Geographic distribution through cloud deployment
   - Hidden primary authoritative server configuration

3. **Zone Transfer Security**
   - Restricted zone transfers with appropriate controls
   - Transaction signatures (TSIG) for securing zone transfers

4. **Protective DNS Measures**
   - Email security configurations (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Encrypted transport for some connections

## Recommendations for Enhanced Compliance

### 1. Encrypted DNS Expansion (Section 4.2.1)
- Implement DNS over TLS (DoT) or DNS over HTTPS (DoH) more broadly
- Add configuration for encrypted DNS recursive resolvers
- Documentation states: *"Encrypt internal and external DNS traffic wherever feasible"*

### 2. Dedicated DNS Services (Section 2.3.1)
- Further separate DNS services from other critical functions
- Reduce attack surface by implementing dedicated DNS server instances
- Documentation states: *"The infrastructure that hosts DNS services should be dedicated to that task"*

### 3. DNS Monitoring and Logging (Section 2.1.3)
- Implement comprehensive DNS query logging through DNSTAP
- Integrate DNS logs with SIEM solutions for analysis
- Document states: *"Logging should capture both current and historical DNS traffic to enable digital forensics and incident response"*

### 4. Zone Content Security (Section 3.2)
- Implement additional measures to prevent zone drift and zone thrash
- Add controls for lame delegation prevention
- Documentation states: *"Different types of data in the zone file result in different security exposures and potential threats"*

### 5. External Domain Integrity (Section 3.6)
- Add monitoring for look-alike domains and typosquats
- Implement controls against dangling CNAME exploitation
- Documentation states: *"Threat actors often target legitimate public-facing DNS domains"*

## Implementation Priorities

1. **High Priority**: Implement encrypted DNS (DoT/DoH) for enhanced privacy and security
2. **Medium Priority**: Establish comprehensive DNS logging and monitoring
3. **Medium Priority**: Add external domain monitoring for typosquatting and domain abuse
4. **Lower Priority**: Further service isolation for DNS infrastructure

By implementing these recommendations, your DNS infrastructure will more closely align with the comprehensive security guidance provided in NIST SP 800-81r3, enhancing the overall security posture of your organization's DNS services.
